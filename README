Manage Projects with Cargo.

Rust ships with a tool names Cargo that assists with your day-to-day interactions with the lanaguage.
Cargo handles everything from making projects to fetching packagess of pre-made code.
It can run your programs and call other tools to fix your code formatting and find common errors.
Cargo is a Swiss Army Knife -- it has a tool for everything.

How to setup a new project with Cargo:

Open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the home directory you selected for your Rust code.
Don't create a new subdirectory for your project -- Cargo will do that for you.
Type cargo new[project name].
Rust has created a subdirectory names[project name]. Enter it with cd[project name].

Cargo baiscally creates a ew git repo for your program. if you don't want git then issues

cargo new --vcs=none [project name]

clippy is a tool to analyze the code and provide us with warning and issues.

If we have to make clippy more strict 
`#![warn(clippy::all, clippy::pedantic)]`


Package Management with code :

Cargo can install dependencies for you. There's an ever-growing number of crates (Rust's name for packages) available for free on the crates.io system.
Cargo makes it easy to install and use these crates, as well as to publish your own.

use cargo search[search term] or visit crates website 

Once we find the needed crate we can add it to dependencies in Cargo.toml file.

Dependencies can be removed from your project  by deleting them from cargo.toml file and then do a cargo clean command.
